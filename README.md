# PhoneSensorDataNNmodel

This is a part of smartphone security project. Here I present a convolutional NN model to analyze the phone sensor data. 
The sensor data is a series of read of accelerometer gyroscope.
The label data is classification of walking, drving, turn, backing, and transition between these states.
